Docker deployment

Functional programming
- code does what we want it to do
- no side effects
- data structures (data) do not change
- input is immutable

- iterators, generators
- important when we pass functions as arguments (flow of data)

- immutability - tuple
- thread safety

- pure functions - no modifying external values, no side effects
- we have to specifically access external values by the global keyword to change it
- always returns the same output for the same input

- easier tests (not dependent on external state)
- simplified debugging

Django
- MTV Model Template View
- MVC Model View Controller
