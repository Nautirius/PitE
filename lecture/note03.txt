Testing

unit testing

we should create tests while writing code

unittest library
- setUp  - runs before every test
- @classmethod setUpClass(cls) - runs once

mocking
- isolate unit of code
- setting up values for specific cases
- control external dependencies
- simulate edge cases
- improve test performance

unit test targets a specific thing (very directed)
for mock the task is bigger (connects different modules, input)

debugging

profiling
- trying to understand how fast is your code running and what part of code runs how fast
- finding bottlenecks, improving on them
- only when we need to optimize code
- @profiling wrapper (code to copy from the internet)
- easy to find bottlenecks
